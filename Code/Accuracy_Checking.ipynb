    "    \"is Israel scrambled big time to intercept an unprecedented attack from Iran the IDF was also involved in very heavy back and forth fighting with his Bella  beer on back group launched a significant number of rockets from Southern Lebanon into the israeli-occupied Golan Heights area on the border with Syria early Sunday is Bella which has threatened to retaliate against against this route for the bombing of a rounds Consulate in Damascus issued a statement saying the attacks were in support of Palestinians in Gaza and this comes after the IDF as it carried out air strikes on his bottle of targets inside Lebanon including a large military complex run by his Bella the stepped up attacks raising concerns right now that the conflict could spread throughout the region has been weeded minutes in Beirut for us then Isabella has not released another statement praising around attack on his route so how might Israel respond  at the moment wolf it doesn't appear that things are going to radically change on the border between Israel and Lebanon know today I counted seven possibly more Israeli strikes on his Butler targets only to his Butler counter strikes on Israeli targets the sort of thing they could really change the situation is if Israel responds to the Iranian barrage of drones cruise missiles and ballistic missiles last night we've heard from a source close to his Butler if things escalate between Iran and Israel Beyond last night that certainly has Bella and other militias and proxies affiliated with Iran will basically dramatically Escalade but until then  I think we're going to see a continuation of this deadly sometimes deadly daily is Bailey rather and sometimes deadly exchanges between the Hezbollah and Israel now speaking to other sources here they have indicated however it is real in the long-term does planned to try to take decisive action against Hezbollah we've heard for instance then unlike in November last year when there was that brief truce between Israel and Gaza and I must his bullet-proof that truce and so did Israel so the Border was quiet the expectation is even if there is some sort of C Spire in Gaza  the Border here will not be quiet I suspect that's going to heat up big-time Ben wiedemann in Beirut Lebanon for us then thank you very much and our special coverage will continue right after a quick break in the short time from the United Nations security Council will hold an emergency meeting in New York and it comes as we're learning that a ronto the us through a private message that it's done with its retaliation against Israel it's bringing Robin Wright She's a fellow over at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in a contributing writer at the New Yorker magazine Robin thanks very much for joining us how do you read a rounds message that it's retaliation that is over  well the fact that it sent this message even as its attacks continue that is its missiles and grounds were still in the air is a signal that it really wanted to have this one and done at least you're the danger at the moment is that Israel's playing the short-term it has military superiority it can whether it's eliminate Iran's arsenals of pushback its allies in the region or kill its military leaders but it doesn't really have a long-term strategy when it comes to what area schools is it took the chain Iran is it to eliminate its nuclear program is it to you do push for regime change in the meantime Iran is playing the long game and it is willing to undertake what was a very daring and unprecedented garage or swarm of attacks  on his real but if you do is is playing for the long term it is over the last 42 years has taken what was a group of small-scale militias and turn it into the most powerful Alliance in the Middle East is real now faces conflicts militias well armed militias on five Frontiers in the least and that's you know that's not something that one attack on Consulate in Damascus or 1 Counter-Strike after what happened last night is going to eliminate that they've crossed the threshold in the Middle East and there's no willing it back though this region well how did it run view this action was around the leadership Robin United on this decision to attack Israel  is now it kind of full of ultra hardliners they're down to the shed many of the layers of other revolutionaries along the way there is a sense that the regime is kind of paranoid right now it feels since the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal with the tensions playing out with Israel and now over Gaza Iran feels more of an existential threat I suspect there was some debate there always is it in Tehran but they moved barely expeditiously and mobilizing what was the largest attack by Iran Israel unprecedented the only one you know since the revolution of 1979 the shop but before then Israel in a run under the shot and very strong relations they were almost like a lies in that part of the world but all that changed in 1979 during the overthrow of the shop he is  President Isaac hurts I told me in the last hour or so here on CNN that Israel doesn't seek war and is considering its options he said cool Heavenly and lucidly how much is r.l. respond are you what do you think  Israel has a lot of options and they're not just kinetic that you can engage in cyber campaigns it you know its abilities are far beyond Israel so it has I think a number of options we're all looking for what kind of physical strike eat my engage in as it did in the Revolutionary leadership that was based in Syria are there other places it would act as well other places where Ron operates you know beyond a serious in many places where it is on his allies so there are a number of options the question is what is the long-term goal and how do you achieve it in Gaza there is no visible or viable plan to defuse tensions we all know how they might escalate but there's no means of pulling it back trying to get the tutu you know. Go after each other whether it show  from a long-term I think that's the real danger of that without some way out that there were all kind of stuck in what is an escalating confrontation Robin write thank you very much for joining us  naked Wolfe\", \n",
    "    \"military a list Cedric Layton to that question their what does that sound like to you if if a Ron communicated to to Turkey about options it was considering it would know where is a NATO Ally the turkey Mike pick up the phone and call Washington and say here what were what we're hearing is that deliberate I think it is just you know I hate the way I look at it after I heard that reported was like yeah the unions were clearly sending a signal to the us through the Turks it is like you said there is turkey a NATO Ally and did the big thing here is that we have you know so many different a different elements you know this is Turkey right here bordering Iran I and the main thing is that the Turks to of courses they I have a integrated defense system with us and they've had a relationship with us as well even though their relationship has been Rocky of late but at the rainiest knew that they were going to talk to the US and they I think clearly when it to Telegraph this  multiple partners coming from from several directions you have Israel here of course you had us Assets in the Eastern Mediterranean us assets down here in the Red Sea not sure in the Persian Gulf as well yes they were certainly assets and it's pretty clear to me that is specifically at al-udeid air base and cut her they would probably have been involved possibly out of Kuwait as well and we believe that gives you a sense of the net of defenses that were able to shoot down these missiles and drones they were coming from Iran absolutely and they had this is about a thousand miles from here to hear they had that whole area in which actually see what was going on it actually take a look at you know the different different types of projectiles I originally had 270 drone over 120 ballistic missiles 30 cruise missiles in fact 70 of those drones as we've reported I was shot down by the US assets so that really does make a big difference  time to buy you a cruise missiles there faster but you could see them when I was in Ukraine I could see them in the sky you can pick them out and that gave time to Target and defend absolutely leave time because you got 1,000 miles distance right here Jim that gives you time to do this now the one key thing there was when you look at you know for example I what is happening here this is gun camera footage from the IDF as they are blowing a drone out of the sky by the way we know that fighter jets were involved in Israeli but us fighter jets and I believe British fighter jets as well that's correct and there were other assets that were out there then of course they have that capability than with the Iron Dome of course you have the capability to shoot things down from the ground so you've got are assets that are engaged in this and you've got ground assets as if part of this air defense network that the Israelis have the undoing being the short version of the of two other systems that do medium and longer range and those systems of course provided an entire picture for everybody  do defense as well be that that that involve shooting down a missile that went into space that's right and it's what's interesting about this is that there were so many ballistic missiles these are the quickest ones these are the ones that can basically cover this distance within a few minutes the drones to take up to 9 hours to reach this particular distance to painting on the specific ground and then of course you have cruise missiles to take about 2 hours or so depending let me ask you this because there's been talked for years about a rounds missile capabilities not just fired from a Ron but also fired from saying around and proxy here in Lebanon where were they have many thousands of them in the concern had been so many whether it's from Lebanon here of course has Bilal Abbas has its own rocket capability than from Iran so many that they would be able to overwhelm Israeli defense is based on the response tonight does that show you a shortcoming yes I think it does show a shortcoming on the part of the arrangements because  they did try to do what amounted to a swarm attack when you look at the quantity that we're dealing with here you can see that there are so many different things that the Iranians could have done if they thought they could overwhelm the system but because of these kinds of things happening we were able to actually interceptors were these really were able to intercept this in this particular case and they were able to take out a really really large proportion of both the Browns and the message this is exactly the kind of attack that Ukraine is enduring everyday from Russia a mix of drones and missiles and cruise missiles with far more limited defenses and by the way shortages now some of these air defense missiles absolutely in one of the key things to think about here everybody talks about Ukraine that you're going it alone and doing those kinds of things that the Israelis to remember these Israelis had a very sophisticated air defense system but three layered defense system as we talked about and they had a lot of help in doing it so if you want the ukrainians to be  successful is the Israelis are several factors involved here they've a lot more space to deal with but if you want them to be successful you need to help them and that's the difference here don't have directly shooting down Russian missiles and drones coming in even if they devastate that Ukrainian cities Center Clayton thanks so much as always\", \n",
    "    \"right now we're keeping a very close eye on the extremely tense situation in the Middle East Israel Boeing respond to Saturday's a rainy and drone and missile attack as the US tries to keep a conflict from spiraling out of control let's check in with our chief International correspondent Clarissa Ward she's ruining his life in Tel Aviv right now cuz Clarissa how is Israel weighing its next steps  well today wolf we had the 4th session of the war cabinet since Saturday night's attack that meeting went on for something like 3 hours and there was no announcement at the end of it as to what is rails leadership has decided in terms of a response to around but there are definitely I would say wolf growing Rumblings that that response is likely to be sooner rather than later the question becomes what will it look like will Israel he the caution that is being urged by many of its allies including the us to try not to escalate will it he'd you know the forceful cries from some elements of the government here for tickly part of that right-wing Coalition that Netanyahu has who are calling for forceful attack to re-establish a deterrent will it be a direct hit for Tat hitting some kind of a military installation would it possibly be an asymmetric attack focusing on one of Iran's numerous proxies in the region could it be  cybertech these are all the various options that have been considered and now the region really just bracing itself waiting and watching to see what will happen if course real concerns from some quarters but this could potentially escalate the situation further impact Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza  well I think it depends on the prospective you're looking at it from Wolf some will say that this has been a Lifeline to Netanyahu because it's really deflect attention away from Gaza away from the withering criticism that Israel has faced about its handling of Gaza is really still adamant that it is going to proceed ahead with that incursion into Rocawear someone million Palestinians are currently hunkered down unclear as to how this will affect the timeline with a focus on it Rhonda tracks from the focus on God's of but there is certainly domestic pressure from here and Israel or some kind of win or what would be viewed as a win in Israel on that front particularly with those hostage cease-fire talks just completely stalled will completely stalled in indeed Clarissa ward in Tel Aviv for a thank you very much so let's get some more in the breaking news CNN has learned that house Republican leaders will try to pass for separate foreign aid bills  provide assistance to Ukraine Israel and Taiwan but it's unclear whether conservative hardliners in the house will accept that joining me not Democratic senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut is a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Center thank you so much for joining us what's your reaction to this latest plan by the house to Republican leadership to pass for separate bills decoupling Aid to Israel from Ukraine Aid that may potentially bundle these before sending them to the Senate but is that something you could support decoupling all these bills these four different proposals so I certainly can't comment on how they would fare in the senator where do I vote for them but it's a disturbing development of the speaker of the house has a bill in front of him right now that is passed the Senate would 70 be a huge bipartisan majority it funds Ukraine if funds as relief funds important humanitarian relief and it helps Taiwan defend itself  that bill is supported by the majority of his members and he is still continue to refuse to call it up for a vote that bill to be in the president's desk tomorrow if you're Johnson just called for a vote so every two days he seems to have a new plan as to how he is going to avoid doing the right thing just taking a vote letting his members decide on what they feel about the Senate proposal that funds Ukraine this new plan I don't know how we'll fare in the house I don't know how it will fare in the Senate what I know is that it inevitably just delays getting funding to both Israel and Ukraine both of those countries needs help desperately right now over the weekend when you look at how successfully Israel and its its Partners defended against the others missiles that we're coming in a little damage around actually did on the ground in Israel what it do  Counter-Strike from Israel on a run you think that would go too far  well first of all this attack from Iran is unacceptable and I am glad that Israel was able to shoot down all these incoming missiles and drones but he was a lot of skill involved in that for probably some luck as well we could easily be dealing with dozens if not hundreds of dead Israelis today to make everyone knows by now that the United States is counseling Israel to engage in a strategy moving forward that doesn't escalate this conflict any further it certainly appears that the way in which the Run conducted the strike was telegraphing the fact that it does not want to be engaged in a deeper bloody or long-term conflict and right now with our ships being shot at in the Red Sea with Gaza still on fire with unrest in Jordan This is the absolute wrong time for there to be an additional new broader conflict in the region  the White House says this decision is now up to Israel listen to this listen  this is an Israeli decision to make whether and how they'll respond we're going to leave it squarely with them we are not involved in their decision-making process about a potential response  so Senator what should the u.s. Roby and what advice should you really be receiving from the United States considering the risk to US troops throughout the middle east region if this conflict where to spiral what Israel is a Sovereign Nation in this was undoubtedly a vicious attack on their territory in on their people so is real has a right to determine for themselves how they respond I think the president's been right to say this is Israel's decision the United States is not going to participate in this attack and I think it's important for us to signal to Israel that the way in which they respond needs to be and should be calculated so as not to get is real or the United States more deeply involved in a direct confrontation with their on right now that is not good for Israeli security is not good for u.s. security our Focus right now needs to be on getting those hostages out of Gaza bringing the war in Gaza to a closed there's already been enough damage  Israel's National Security and to the US National Security we don't need another wider dangerous conflict with Iran thank you\",\n",

    "    \"a few years ago  I suddenly had a lot of extra time to spend staring out the window maybe you did a little bit of that too in quarantine at the start of the pandemic and while we were locked down I got kind of fascinated with what we still moving out there  like the local crows  who went on with their normal commute down the side of the mountain every morning  and up again every evening at Crow quitting time  Birds of Prey came out everyday and made their rounds  I'm using a process here called photo stacking where you take multiple pictures from a fixed Point overtime and layer them into one composite photograph  first acting as a way to show the trails of things like stars fireflies athletes airplanes pretty much anything that moves its way to make the shape of those movements visible  most of these have between five hundred and $2,000 they take a long time to build and a lot of that time is spent just experimenting with which layers to keep in and wish to leave out of the final image  hear a group of pelicans came in from one side and noticed something intriguing in the water  then another who came in from the other side and circled around to check it out  so this isn't one moment Frozen in Time like a traditional photograph but something more like a story told in two Dimensions with layers of the fourth dimension kind of  looking at flight Trails this way  you really noticed some of the rhyming patterns that repeat everywhere in nature like waves of sound or water or spiraling galaxies whirlpools and storms  and sometimes they seem to sort of sketch out other things that are usually invisible to us  like the thermal updrafts that Hawks and vultures ride on finding even the smallest patches of turbulence in the air to carry them  while I was working on these I learned that some vultures are so good at this that they can soar that way without flapping their wings at all four hours  which has to be the most meditative way there is to look for carrying  and this is what it looks like to navigate by shouting  bats are characterized as either Whispers or shouters and we're lucky that the range of our hearing ends right about where their voices begin because the shelves can get up to 140 decibels as loud as a jet engine  what we call silence is just the limit our hearing I love to think about that and about how most of the creatures from European moles to rainbow trout  find a way by wavelength of light or sound or field of electricity or magnetism that our senses just aren't set up for  and those are just the ways that we know about  in the 1930s the British ornithologist Edmund seduced studied flocks of Starlings moving together as if they had one mind and wrote a book on his conclusion that the birds must be psychic  and you know there's still no evidence that they're not but we now know that they follow each other with a split second lag time that's just too short for a human sense of time  and maybe for some predators like the peregrine falcon in the middle there  so these are pictures of group decisions made at a speed that makes them invisible to us pictures of the Hidden intelligence and what might look at first random or even chaotic  reminder is that the Universe isn't built to our measure  but operates on systems beyond our perception  that what we call empty are is anything but empty if you're a bad it holds the sound of the shape of a hillside  it's also a map of magnetic signals and electrical fields  and the Topography of the smell is a Krill patches and Plankton blooms  we humans have invented whole digital worlds but sometimes we still need to be reminded that there's more in this Heaven and Earth than is dreamt of in our philosophy  and if there are endless ways to look at familiar sights  like a bird in Flight with fresh eyes  to expand our shared experience in a way that connects us with the rest of the Living World  to feel about his kinship with our fellow creatures and respect and even reverence for their other nests  in the words of the poet and naturalist Jared K Anderson  bats can hear shapes plants can eat light bees can dance Mass  we can hold all these ideas at once and feel both heavy and weightless with the Absurd beauty of it all  thank you\", \n",
